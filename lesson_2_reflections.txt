What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
When you initialize a repository it creates a .git file which stores
meta deta so that you can then create commits and track your progress
throughout a project.  You need to do in order to access older
versions of your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a middle ground in which things from the working
directory are about to be stored in the repository. It allows you to
submit one commit for changes to multiple files, once all files have
the change made.  You can add files individually to the the staging
area before making a commit so that you don't end up with individual
commits for one change that involves multiple files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?
You can use the staging area as a temporary holding area, then
compare it to the working directory and the most recent commit to
make sure that there is only/at least one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful when making diff versions of your project,
for example different languages, different levels of difficulty,
different color schemes.  This would allow you to make progress in
multiple versions without having to continuously go back to an old
commit to do so.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams help sort out the different branches and clarify how
different commits are related since commits are not always made in a
linear fashion.
